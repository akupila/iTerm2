# Prettier iTerm2

**NOTE: This is a fork, you probably want [the original one](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2)**

## Changes

- Removes title bar
- Adds some padding around the content

## Known issues

- Shows a tiny grey bar on top, visible against dark backgrounds
- Doesn't work well with transparent windows

This was hacked together in a couple minutes, there are likely a bunch of problems with this so proceed with caution..
