# Prettier iTerm2

**NOTE: This is a fork, you probably want [the original one](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2)**

Inspired by [hyperterm](https://github.com/zeit/hyperterm) I set out to see if iTerm2 could be tweaked to remove the title bar. This is very much a proof of concept done in couple minutes and probably has a bunch of issues so proceed with caution..

## Changes

- Removes title bar
- Adds some padding around the content

## Known issues

- Shows a tiny grey bar on top, visible against dark backgrounds
- Doesn't work with transparent windows
- Going fullscreen and back restores (a weird looking) titlebar
